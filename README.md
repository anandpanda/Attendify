# Attendify
Attendify is a web-based AI attendance system that uses facial recognition to automate tracking. Teachers upload classroom photos, and the system detects and matches student faces with the database to mark attendance. Built with Python, OpenCV, React.js, and MySQL/MongoDB, it saves time, reduces errors, and improves efficiency.

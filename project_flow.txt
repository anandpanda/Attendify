1. make the students stand up row by row

2. click picture of the row

3. preview the detected faces to the user

4. if the detected faces are satisfactory, submit the picture

5. the submitted pictures should be under processing while the remaining row pictures are being clicked

6. the list of all the students will be stored 

7. after all the images are processed, the user should be able to generate a initial attendance list

8. initial list will be matched against all_students_list to find absentees

7. the absentees and detected but unrecognized faces should be shown to the user for manual recognition

9. the user will be able to mark the manually recognized faces as present

10. the final attendance list will be generated



Manage image processing queue.
Ensure that the system processes each submitted image while allowing for additional images to be captured and submitted.
Database:

Track the processing status of each image.
6. The List of All the Students Will Be Stored
Frontend:

Interface for uploading the list of all students.
Backend:

Endpoint to receive and store the student list (e.g., /api/upload_students_list).
Database:

Store the list of all students with details (e.g., IDs, names).
7. After All Images Are Processed, Generate an Initial Attendance List
Backend:

Analyze all processed images.
Generate initial attendance based on face recognition results.
Database:

Store the generated initial attendance list.
8. Initial List Will Be Matched Against all_students_list to Find Absentees
Backend:

Compare the initial attendance list with the all_students_list.
Identify absentees.
Database:

Store absentee records.
9. Absentees and Detected but Unrecognized Faces Should Be Shown to the User for Manual Recognition
Frontend:

UI to display absentees and unrecognized faces.
Allow manual input for recognizing faces.
Backend:

Endpoint to retrieve absentee and unrecognized face details (e.g., /api/absentees).
10. User Will Be Able to Mark the Manually Recognized Faces as Present
Frontend:

UI for marking faces as present.
Button or form for submitting manual recognition.
Backend:

Endpoint to update attendance with manually recognized faces (e.g., /api/mark_present).
Database:

Update attendance records with manual input.
11. The Final Attendance List Will Be Generated
Backend:

Compile the final attendance list including both automatic and manual inputs.
Generate and return the final list to the frontend.
Database:

Store the final attendance list.
Summary of Communication:
Frontend: User interface interactions, image capture, face detection preview, manual recognition.
Backend: Handles API requests, image processing, face recognition, attendance generation, status updates.
Database: Stores student lists, image details, attendance records, processing status, and manual inputs.
Each step involves a combination of frontend interactions, backend processing, and database management to ensure a smooth and efficient attendance system.
